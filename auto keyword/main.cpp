#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int a = 5;

    //auto automatically deduces the type for the variable
    //must still use references when applicable
    auto b = a;

    //more useful for obnoxious/confusing object types
    //can also be used as a generic

    //personally helpful for iterators
}
